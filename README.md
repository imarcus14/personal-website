# Personal Website

This is my personal website that was built using HTML, SCSS, JavaScript, and React. 

For this project I was inspired after watch CodewithSloba's videos on Youtube, and managed to integrate some styles and pieces from it into my own. The video is linked here:

Watching the video an integrating some aspects allowed me to learn to use different libraries and different methods of styling compared to what I had already learned.
